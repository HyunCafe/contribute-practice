## Introduction

Welcome to Your First GitHub Contribution!

This repository is the perfect starting point for those new to coding or open-source contribution. Here, you'll get hands-on practice with the basics of GitHub collaboration - from forking and cloning a repository to pushing changes and creating pull requests.

I have prepared a set of straightforward tasks to guide you through each step of the contribution process, complete with detailed instructions. Ready to embark on your open-source journey? Fork this repository, clone it to your local system, and let's dive in!
<br><br>

## Objectives

- Provide an introduction and overview of the repository for first-time contributors.
- Explain the process of forking a repo, cloning it to a local machine, making changes and submitting a pull request.
- Include simple tasks for contributors to complete with step-by-step instructions on how to submit changes.
- Encourage contributors to fork and clone the repo and get started with making contributions. <br><br><br>

## Fork this repo

<h2> Step 1 </h2>
<img align="right" width="400" src="assests/forkrepo.JPG" alt="step 1 fork this repo drown down button" /> <br>

- Click on the "Fork" drop down button located in the top right corner of the page.

- Click on the "+ Create a new fork\* <br><br><br>

<h2> Step 2 </h2>
<img align="right" width="550" src="assests/createforkrepo.JPG" alt="step 2 fork this repository addition" /> <br>

- Click on "Create fork" <br><br>

- Once the repository has been forked, you will be taken to the forked repository's page. <br><br>

- This will be a copy of the original repository, but it will be under your account. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

## Clone this repo

<img align="right" width="400" src="assests/clonestep1.JPG" alt="step 1 click code then ssh then copy" /> <br>

- First, lets click on the "Code" drop down button, click on "SSH" then click the "Copy Icon" <br>

- Then, let's go to our local machine, open the terminal, and create a new directory to put our newly cloned repo in and name it "contribute-practice"

```
mkdir contribute-practice
```

- and cd into the directory

```
cd contribute-practice
```

- Clone the forked repository to your local machine by typing git clone followed by the SSH link that you copied.

```
git clone copyoftheurlssh
```

<br><br>

## Create a branch

- Now let's create a new branch through the terminal using the git switch BranchName.

Replace BranchName with the name of the new branch you want to create.

For example:

```
git switch -c branchTest
```

<br><br>

## Contribution time!

- Open the contributing.md file, you can use a text editor of your choice, for example, nano contributing.md or vi contributing.md
  I personally use vs code, so I would type:

```
code .
```

- Follow the directions under the contributing.md, and once you've finished, do the same process for readme.md (so that your username and quotes are displayed in both files)

- Now lets commit your changes!

- Remember the order for git best practices! <br>
  git status >> git add (files changed) >> git commit -m "insert short description of changes made" >> git push

type:

```
git status
```

now you can see the files that were changed, now add them (In this case, it should be contributing.md and readme.md)

```
git add (files changed)
```

now lets commit our changes with a short description

```
git commit -m "Add: Added my name to list, My first contribution!"
```

Push the changes to your forked repository on GitHub using the command git push origin BranchName, where BranchName is the name of the branch you are working on.

```
git push -u origin BranchName
```

<br><br>

## Making a Pull Request

<h2> Step 1 </h2>
<img align="right" width="400" src="assests/prstep1.JPG" alt="step 1 Pull request" /> <br><br><br><br><br>

- Go to your forked repository on GitHub, click on "contribute" drop down, and click on "Open pull request"<br><br><br>

<br><br><h2> Step 2 </h2>
<img align="right" width="400" src="assests/prstep2.JPG" alt="step 2 Pull request" /> <br>

- Fill in the title and description of the pull request to explain the changes you made!

- After filling out the details, click the "Create pull request" button to submit your request for review. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

## Great job! All done! Wasn't so bad was it?

- Congratulations on completing the typical fork, clone, make changes, and pull request workflow commonly used by contributors. Keep up the good work and continue contributing!

- I will get around to merging the request when I can, I am usually good about it! <br><br>
